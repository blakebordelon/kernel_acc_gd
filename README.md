README File for Approximate Architecture Search with Accelerated Kernel Methods

kernel_mse.ipynb contains code to run kernel regression on least squares for CIFAR-10(0)

kernel_classifiaction.ipynb performs kernel logistic regression with crossentropy loss

architecture_search.ipynb contains code for finite size neural network experiments and a few full batch GD kernel regression experiments

We ran our experiments on Google Colab with the provided GPU

Dependencies: Anaconda dependencies, tensorflow datasets, Pytorch, Jax, Neural Tangents package
